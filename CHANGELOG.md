## Version 3.0.4 - 08.10.2025

### 🎯 New Features - Selective Field Hiding for Classic Checkout

Previously, when Econt shipping was selected, the entire `#customer_details` container was hidden. This version provides granular control over which individual checkout fields to hide.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Choose specific billing fields to hide (first name, last name, country, address, city, state, phone, email, company)
- ✅ Choose specific shipping fields to hide (when "Ship to different address" is enabled)
- ✅ Add custom CSS selectors for theme-specific or custom fields
- ✅ Backward compatible - if no fields selected, entire container is hidden (legacy behavior)
- ✅ Works with standard WooCommerce checkout
- ✅ Compatible with custom themes and page builders (Elementor, Divi, etc.)

**Benefits:**
- Better user experience - only hide fields that Econt will auto-fill
- Keep important fields visible (e.g., email for account creation)
- Theme compatibility - add custom selectors for modified themes
- Flexibility for different store configurations

### 🔧 Changes

#### Backend
- **Modified:** `bootstrap.php` to pass field configuration to JavaScript via `wp_localize_script` (Classic)
- **Modified:** `class-econt-blocks.php` to pass field configuration to JavaScript (Block)
- **Added:** Field configuration data structure: `hiddenBillingFields`, `hiddenShippingFields`, `customHiddenSelectors`
- **Added:** Input sanitization for new settings fields
- **Added:** Settings callbacks in `class-delivery-with-econt-options.php`
- **Added:** `econtData.fieldConfig` for block checkout
