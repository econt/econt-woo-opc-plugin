## Version 3.0.4 - 08.10.2025

### üéØ New Features - Selective Field Hiding for Classic Checkout

Previously, when Econt shipping was selected, the entire `#customer_details` container was hidden. This version provides granular control over which individual checkout fields to hide.

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Choose specific billing fields to hide (first name, last name, country, address, city, state, phone, email, company)
- ‚úÖ Choose specific shipping fields to hide (when "Ship to different address" is enabled)
- ‚úÖ Add custom CSS selectors for theme-specific or custom fields
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible - if no fields selected, entire container is hidden (legacy behavior)
- ‚úÖ Works with standard WooCommerce checkout
- ‚úÖ Compatible with custom themes and page builders (Elementor, Divi, etc.)

**Benefits:**
- Better user experience - only hide fields that Econt will auto-fill
- Keep important fields visible (e.g., email for account creation)
- Theme compatibility - add custom selectors for modified themes
- Flexibility for different store configurations
